today when i run my metasploit linux 2 in vbox,it told me that "The VM session was aborted (0x80004005)".
i try to reinstall vbox,but it doesn't work.i try to search the error with google,but those solution is useless.
when i try run other virtual machine,only kali can work,and xp show the usb device is not avialieble,then i turn off it,xp can work well.
so i try turn off usb device on other virtual machines.after that they all can work well.
but i still dont now the reason.
